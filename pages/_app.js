/*
Random Life Lesson via Lok Lok.
The necessity of forgiveness.

If they dare to do bad stuff,
they dare to leave records in time.
Time is important because Good cannot be cancelled
and bad cannot be cheated.

Forgiveness is so important ❤
It's truly truly the whole point. ❤
Love covers a multitude of sins. ❤
God forgives us first, we forgive one another.

We all make mistakes, we all forgives at times.
If others forgive me, but I dont forgive others.
It would show much of a bad person I am.

I dont want to be unforigving.
I choose forgivness in mind and I do it in life.

Thank you Jesus for the way of life.
